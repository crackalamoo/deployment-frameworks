## Deployment Frameworks

## Overview
### VueJS
VueJS was a good development experience. This VueJS also uses Jquery.
### ReactJS
ReactJS was a bad development experience, forcing you to manually write HTML code in Javascript with things like for loops. VueJS and AngularJS, on the other hand, had v-for and ng-repeat which helped much more.
### AngularJS
AngularJS was a good development experience like VueJS. This AngularJS also uses Jquery and Bootstrap.

## Load times
Each framework was tested 10 times. For ReactJS, I had to time it manually since gh-pages wasn't using the code properly. Because of this, I have only the total loading times, not the "initial loading" or time it took to load the module.
For full load time data, see the Loading_Times excel file.

Also, there is a python folder including the python data analysis I did with transaction data.
