## Deployment Frameworks

### VueJS
VueJS was a good development experience and is relatively lightweight.
### ReactJS
Normally, for ReactJS, you have to add "/home" to the directory. The problem is, it isn't actually working on github pages. It only works on localhost. Besides, it was a bad development experience, forcing you to manually write HTML code in Javascript with things like for loops. VueJS and AngularJS, on the other hand, had v-for and ng-repeat which helped much more.
### AngularJS
AngularJS was a good development experience like VueJS, but it is heavy.
